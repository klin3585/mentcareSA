Requirements! We need to come up with at least 10 functional requirements and at least 2 nonfuntional requirements for MentCare.
I'm not entirely sure what all that means, but hopefully we'll know more after tomorrow's class.
I will explain what functional and non-functional requirements are

Functional Requirements:
1. details of patient information
2. authorization of patient information
3. UI ( Login screens, main page, tabbed interfaces, etc)
4. Database to hold patients
5. Different health options
6.
7.

10.

Non Functional Requirements:
1. Security
2. Usability
